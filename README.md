# Multiple Linear Regression Estimation of Sales DataFrame ðŸ“Š


*  Multiple linear regression helps you estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

*  In this Notebook, you will be analyzing a small business' historical marketing promotion data. Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where their business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales. They previously had you work on finding a single variable that predicts sales, and now they are hoping to expand this analysis to include other variables that can help them target their marketing efforts.

Will conduct a multiple linear regression analysis to estimate sales from a combination of independent variables. This will include:

*  Exploring and cleaning data
*  Using plots and descriptive statistics to select the independent variables
*  Creating a fitting multiple linear regression model
*  Checking model assumptions
*  Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to non-technical stakeholders
